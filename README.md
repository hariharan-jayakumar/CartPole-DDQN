## Motivation

To gain an introduction to implementing Reinforcement Learning in code, I read the book 'Deep Reinforcement Learning in Action' by Brandon Brown, Alexander Zai. Following up on this book, I started with my first Reinforcement Learning project - teaching an agent to balance a stick for the longest time possible.

The simplicity of the problem statement and the relative ease in understanding and coding this acted as the driving factors for me.
